Giphy API was integrated in this single page site to allow the user's selection of gifs to populate.
https://chloeekitts.github.io/GiphyAPI/


User can click on existing search terms, or add their own search, and the page will dynamically generate 10 gifs for that key term. If you click on the image it will toggle between a still image and an animated gif. This also shows the ability to utilize AJAX calls using jQuery.

When the site loads, 10 predetermined office "Slack" terms are available to click on and demonstrate the AJAX call and gif functions. User is able to add a custom search button to the list which populates the appropriate Giphy images based on the key word.
